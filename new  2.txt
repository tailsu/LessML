1. strings are sacred:
there are many forms of strings that disambiguate shorthands or special needs inside data. think CDATA

"a string"
	"another string"
	"one more" = "some value"
	"let's do this" := "one more time"
	
<XML>escaped "string"<XML>: lives here

2. form is simple and flexible

&sigiled ::=:: property value
	!sigiledprop (infix) something weird
	
you have sigils, a property name (with limitations to character set), an infix which is:
* a string of punctuation, or
* any string enclosed in some form of brackets or parentheses
, and finally a value which can be anything that the string form allows
